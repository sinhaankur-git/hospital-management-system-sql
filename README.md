## 🧠 Features Covered

- ✅ Normalized Schema Design
- ✅ Primary / Foreign Keys & Constraints
- ✅ ENUM, DATE, TIMESTAMP types
- ✅ `AUTO_INCREMENT` usage
- ✅ Stored Procedures (Appointment booking, Billing, Payment)
- ✅ Triggers (Audit deleted patients)
- ✅ Views (Doctor schedule, Patient visit summary)
- ✅ Realistic sample data
- ✅ GitHub-ready SQL project structure

## 🏗️ Schema Overview

**Entities:**
- Doctors
- Patients
- Appointments
- Medical Records
- Billing
- Payments
- Deleted Patients Log (for audit trail)

**Relationships:**
- A patient can have multiple appointments
- Each appointment is with one doctor
- Every appointment can generate billing and medical records
- Payments are made against bills

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or download the `.sql` files
2. Open MySQL Workbench / your preferred MySQL tool
3. Run the following in order:
    - `schema.sql`
    - `data.sql`
    - `views.sql`
    - `triggers.sql`
    - `procedures.sql`
4. Use `CALL` statements to test stored procedures

---

## 🧪 Sample Procedure Usage

```sql
CALL schedule_appointment(202, 101, '2025-04-15', '11:00:00');
CALL mark_appointment_completed(1);
CALL generate_bill_for_appointment(1, 600.00);
CALL make_payment(1, 600.00);
CALL delete_patient(203);  -- triggers audit log
```

---

## 📌 Sample Views

```sql
-- All Appointments for a Doctor
SELECT * FROM Doctor_Appointment_View WHERE doctor_id = 101;

-- Patient Summary
SELECT * FROM Patient_Visit_Summary_View WHERE patient_id = 202;
```
